In Buddhism, mind and awareness are synonymous. Awareness is open and spacious, the container of whatever is experienced. Like a mirror, it does not have any particular color or content of its own, but reflects whatever appears. Thoughts, sense perceptions, emotional feelings, and dreams all appear in your mirrorlike mind. None of these are the mind; they all arise as contents of the mind.

The intention to “make sure I make a good swing” is likely to promote mechanical thinking and self- consciousness, both of which interfere with a free- flowing motion. However, if your purpose is to fulfill an image of the ball flying or rolling to a target, the image fills your mind, and your body swings the club with far less interference.

Finally, here’s a thought that will help you to slow yourself down in that type of situation: Taking an extra few seconds over a putt takes less time than a second or third putt.

To experience a full breath, sit up or stand with good posture and close your eyes. Breathe gently and slowly through your nose. Feel the breath going down the back of your throat. On the next few breaths, feel as if your breath were going into your back, filling it first side to side and then down to your tailbone. You can imagine that your back is like a thin, inflatable camping pad, filling with breath to an even thickness across your whole back. As you breathe gently this way, you’ll feel your shoulder blades widen a bit and the back of your rib cage spread wider.

As long as the tension lingers, when the mind checks on the body, it recognizes tension and figures that “we’re still in danger.” However, if we breathe fully to ease the tension in the body, when the mind checks on the body, it recognizes the lack of tension and concludes that “we’re not in trouble anymore.”

In life as in golf, you give it your best shot when you’re free of tension and self- consciousness. For example, when you have a difficult tee shot or short putt and you’re waiting your turn, it’s not very helpful to stare at it, think about it, and let your mind get very small. Instead, look up and breathe out, opening to expansive awareness. When it’s your turn, you’ll be in a much fresher, open, and settled state of mind.

Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Transitions >  Page 87
</div>
<div class="noteText">
You play your best golf when you plan with your head, then play from your heart. There are two keys to success in making this transition: (1) filling your mind with a vivid image of the shot you intend to play and (2) settling down— clearing away tension and feeling the center of gravity in your body. To do this, you can use a full breath just before you begin your approach to the ball.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Transitions >  Page 89
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The impact of this transition point is most noticeable in putting. Golfers struggling with their putting sometimes freeze, feeling unable to start the putter back for fear of making a bad stroke (or the yips) when they bring it forward again. This is caused by a preoccupation with the future, the results. The remedy is developing and committing to a routine, one with a flowing tempo, that you feel will give you the best chance of fulfilling your intention. Focus totally on the routine, and thoughts of results are less likely to imperil any of your transitions.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Transitions >  Page 89
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The next transition happens at the end of the swing. We transition from actor to observer, sometimes commentator, and all too often critic. In brief, the more awareness and less judgment that takes place in this transition, the better.

</div>
<div class="noteText">
If you missed your putt, there’s a good chance it was because your body was on the putting green but your mind was back in the fairway with the group behind you. If your mind is anywhere but “in your body,” then body and mind are out of sync. This goes for any swing you make on the golf course and any action you undertake anywhere else in your life.

<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) - Synchronizing Body and Mind >  Page 91
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Your mind can be in the present, thinking about your swing, and yet not be synchronized with your body. The key point here is “thinking about.” If you’re thinking about your swing, you’re thinking, not swinging. Your mind is “in your head” with conceptual ideas about how you should swing, rather than “in your body,” running the swing. If mind and body are doing two different things, they’re not synchronized.

He was remembering all the putts he’d missed recently, so now he looked at his putter as the thing he missed putts with. Being a pro who’d played on the PGA Tour, he had lots of expectations that he should make all those short putts and more of the long ones. He felt that others expected him to make them, too. Finally, there was the pressure of playing with his career on the line. His perspective had become one of trying to hole putts instead of trusting his stroke.

<div class="noteText">
For players who need a swing thought, it is better to have one that describes what you intend to do rather than how you intend to do it. For example, the thought “long arms” gives an image of what you want to feel. However, “extend the arms” gives direction about how you want to move. It invites the thinking mind to try to direct the body, which doesn’t work very well. Swing thoughts with an image of a feeling allow the intuitive mind to direct the body.

Once we’ve recognized a fear and put it in perspective, we need to undo its effects before executing the shot. Take the time to breathe fully to counteract the excess tension in your body. Clear your mind of any negative images of what you don’t want to happen, replacing them with positive images of what you do want as the outcome. Then body and mind are synchronized and focused on the shot at hand, without the interference of fear.

One of the participants exclaimed, “I was thinking about how I used my fork to put food in my mouth and I missed!” Here is the point: You don’t need to consciously direct your body for it to hit a target accurately.

We consciously evaluate the extent to which our action matches our intention. However, this is done in practice, using feedback and repetition to develop “grooved” swing habits.

Golfers often have a mistaken notion of trust. They think that trusting their swing means it should be perfectly reliable. We’re human beings, not robots, so our swing doesn’t repeat exactly.

She needed to direct her thinking mind to turn over control to her body. Before each swing, she was to mentally say a phrase such as “It’s all yours” or “Take over.” She chose “Let it fly.” That was the signal for the thinking mind to let go, and trust her body to swing the club without interference. When she did that, the swing she had trained over the years reappeared, as accurate and powerful as ever.

Let’s get it straight— if you didn’t care you wouldn’t be playing golf. But you can care without worrying. If you care in the sense of being interested, you’ll be focused and go through your process and trust your routine, and the stroke will be smooth and free. If you care as in being worried, you’ll be unsynchronized and untrusting, and your stroke will be hesitant and bound up.

Once Peter Jacobsen, a PGA Tour veteran, was asked how he felt about missing a putt on the last hole of a tournament. He said, “I didn’t miss the putt. I made the putt. The ball missed the hole.” That’s exactly the point: Let’s recognize the difference between making a putt and holing a putt.

On an uphill putt, imagine the ball diving into the hole, striking the middle of the back wall. This gives your body the message to stroke the ball firmly, without you needing to think, “Hit it hard.” On a downhill putt, imagine the ball just trickling over the front edge. This gives your body the message to stroke the ball gently, but without the hesitation that comes from the fear of the ball going far past the hole. When you putt with imagination, you’ll be pleasantly surprised at how many putts pour into the hole exactly the way you imagined.

There are different ways to use necessary intention and nonjudgmental awareness to change habits. One is simply counting, like putting pebbles in a bowl. Since pebbles and bowls are a bit awkward on the golf course, I have my players use their scorecards or yardage books. They are to write the name of the habit and make a tick mark each time they notice the behavior they want to change. (Shane, a touring professional, calls it the tick trick.) Count the marks at the end of the round and that’s it for the day. Amazingly, the daily total decreases dramatically after very few rounds.

“In golf they don’t have judges rating the technical merit of the swing, as in diving or gymnastics or figure skating. They don’t give style points.

There’s a particular situation I’d like to address: average golfers who get upset because they hit a shot better than they expected, a drive so solid that it runs through the fairway into the rough or an approach shot so pure that it flies the green. They miss the joy of feeling that pure shot. Yes, you got a bad break, but only because you hit an especially good shot. Fixating on the result robs you of the experience, and you end up feeling bad instead of good.

When a lesson involves making a swing change, most golfers experience a period of poor performance. They find themselves “between swings”: very self- conscious about how they are swinging the club and very inconsistent in their ball striking. Before any improvement starts to appear, they have to weather a time of playing far worse than they are used to. Unfortunately, golfers often give up too soon and go back to their old way of swinging. At that point they get an immediate improvement in performance (from “worse than ever” back to “the usual”) and decide that their old swing was better for them and that the lesson didn’t work.
